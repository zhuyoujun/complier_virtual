# Itâ€™s lecture time! However, whether you go depends on certain conditions about timing,
# seats, and laziness. Write a simple function which lecture that takes in inputs
# time, seats left, is lazy and prints out your decision.
# 	which lecture should print "go to lecture" if time is before 2:00pm, there
# are seats, and you are not lazy.
# 	which lecture should print "go to alt lecture" if time is after 2:00pm or
# there are no seats, and you are not lazy.
# 	which lecture should print "watch videos" if you feel lazy.
# time is in military format; e.g 2:20pm is 1420. seats left is a non-negative integer.
# is lazy is a boolean variable.
